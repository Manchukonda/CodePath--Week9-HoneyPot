# Experience:
The Exposure with the google cloud platform was realtime. The api control and firewall control and the attacks was intresting.
I have encountered around 927 attacks on my honeypot.

# Issues Encountered:
1. I have faced hardtime in browsing the external ip in the browser and opening the admin console of mhn. By inserting the port #80 in the firewall. Then the mhn admin console opened.
2. I have found error while exporting the session.json file from the localsystem by the provided command. I exported with the browser compatability attached gif above.

I am uploading the details which i have got till now. HoneyPot is still running. Will remove the VM instances after the deadline of the assignment.
