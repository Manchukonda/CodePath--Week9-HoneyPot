# Issues Encountered:
1. I have faced hardtime in browsing the external ip in the browser and opening the admin console of mhn. By inserting the port #80 in the firewall. Then the mhn admin console opened.
2. I have found error while exporting the session.json file from the localsystem by the provided command. I exported with the browser compatability attached gif above.
